4. Upgraded rc boat (installing new hardware)
5. Replaced rc car motor (installing new hardware)
6. *Car mount (3D CAD, researching and understanding material properties)
7. Subwoofers (power calculations, RMS, signals, electrical understanding)

### Class Projects:
1. Self balancing robot (embedded systems, Arduino, PID loops, sensors, motor control)
  - PID control in Embedded C with Arduino and IMU. Stabilized 2-wheel platform using tuned proportional, integral, and derivative constants.
3. Mechatronics project (LabVIEW, sensors, actuators, operation logic)
4. Battery Senior Design (electrical testing and design)

### Internship Experience (Summer '24):

### Summer '25:
1. Tradingview indicators (PineScript)
2. Savings and economic forecasting (economic modeling, macro trending, interestest rates, Excel)
3. *Music ML (Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, PyTorch, Classifiers, supervised/unsupervised)
  - Audio feature extraction with Pandas and TensorFlow for supervised/unsupervised classification experiments.
5. *Klipper (Linux, networking, robotics/control loops [open], sensor configurations)
6. *Image and Video Upscaling (Machine Learning)
7. 3D Printing (fine-tuning quality, 3D CAD moddeling)
8. Lego SW:TCS modding (signal processing [ReShade], mod kits)

### Prior to College:
1. Root/dual-boot OS's on tablets, phones, computers.
